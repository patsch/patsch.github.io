One day in 2003 I was on a train in Melbourne, Australia, returning home unusually early from working as a contractor, when I looked
outside and saw two children in their uniforms, holding hands and walking home from school

I realised then that I hardly ever saw what the city I lived in looked like during daytime. I saw it in the early morning and evening, but
I hardly ever saw children returning home from school.

I had two small children of my own at the time - my daughter had just started primary school and my son was in childcare -
and I wasn't seeing them much as I wanted to. So I turned down the next contract extension
and instead started my own business.

#### In the end for me it was all about having more options. Running my own business gave me more options
* more options to organise my working hours
* more options regarding taking holidays when I wanted them
* the freedom to pursue the kind of work I wanted to do
* and also more options where I did my work

More than 10 years on, me & a small team of worker bees are now looking after a number of online businesses, serving consumers, government and corporate customers, with an increasing focus on mobile. I still enjoy building stuff, so
 if you need something done that involves a mobile app, don't hesitate to contact me.
